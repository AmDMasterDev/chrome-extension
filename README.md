# Clocker BOT!
Chrome Extension Which Notifies You on Events Which You Set.

# Limitation I Found Out Later...
Apparently due to lack of knowledge and less time before deadline... It seems that service workers (service worker is a script that runs in the background of the extension, as we're moving into manifest version 3 the way how these background scripts have changed thus creating this limitation) have a timeout and service worker scripts turn inactive after a said duration (from 30sec to 5mins) and there isn't an efficient way to active those workers back active for the extension to function ☹️ so the extension turns inactive once the service worker script turns inactive.
